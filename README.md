# Arkham Proxy

Original from: https://gitlab.com/ahiskali/arkham-proxy/-/tree/master

Only created for easier personal hosting off DigitalOcean

This is a simple web app to get a pdf of cards from a deck on [Arkhamdb](https://arkhamdb.com/).

~~It's live at [https://arkham-proxy.herokuapp.com/](https://arkham-proxy.herokuapp.com/)~~

It's not live since Heroku discontinued their free dynos, I'm looking into another hosting.

## Built With
